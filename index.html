What is volunteertutor.org? </font></u></b>

<p> Volunteertutor.org’s purpose is to introduce K-8 students to volunteer tutors who hopefully meet each other’s tutoring needs.  Tutoring is free and occurs in the relatively safe online environment of Zoom.
<BR><BR>
If you are a person who will get pleasure from being a volunteer tutor in
the convenience and safety of your home, volunteertutor.org may be able to help
you.

<BR><BR>
If your child will benefit from being tutored for free in the convenience and safety of
wherever they have access to a computer, volunteertutor.org may be able to help
them.

<br><br>

Why Use Volunteertutor.org? </font></u></b>

<br><br>
<u>Convenient</u>: no tutor “training” classes, no fingerprint or TB testing, no traveling; the Tutor and Students agree to the meeting time and the methodology.
<br><br><u>Safer</u>: no in-person contacts; potential tutors will be screened on the “National Sex Offender Public Website”. Parents or guardians will sign waivers designed to protect tutors from liability except criminal behavior. Many programs do not have our protections.
<br><br><u>Free</u>: many so called free programs are really traps to sell tutors or students their tutoring experience; neither Tutors nor Students will pay to be part of the volunteertutor.org program.
<br><br><u>Targeted Schools</u>:  an individual can request students from a specific school. 
<br><br><u>Complementary</u>:   Volunteertutor.org believes that there are significant gaps (due to safety concerns, availability and mobility issues, etc) in what is now available to volunteer tutors and students and it is hoping to fill many of those gaps. It is a complementary program; it does not want to compete with the many good, free programs which already meet the needs of their tutors and students.  When a program cannot meet the needs of their tutors or students, volunteertutor.org may be a good alternative.

What Does It Take To Be A Good Tutor? </font></u></b>
<br><br>A good tutor is available on a regular basis least once a week for 20 (younger children) to 40 minutes per session.   Remembering that each student has their particular situation and issues, a good tutor tries to tailor each session to the student’s needs.  Each student makes academic progress at their own pace and therefore a good tutor has a low expectation (and frustration) level.  What can be hoped for is that, over time, there is progress with the student’s attitude toward the subject matter, then academic performance, then self-esteem.

What Does It Take To Be A Good Student? </font></u></b>
<br><br>A good student is available on a regular basis least once a week for 20 (younger children) to 40 minutes per session.  A good student works as hard as they can <u>that day</u> to try to catch-on to what the tutor is teaching.  <u>If they can help it</u>, a good student tries not to get too frustrated or waste the tutor’s time.  

<br><br>
<font size="+1"><u><b>
How Does It Work? </font></u></b><br><br>
Potential tutors must fill out TWO online forms: a Tutor’s Information Form and a Tutor’s Permission Form. After a tutor’s application is accepted, their nick-name, credentials, the subjects and grade level they want to tutor, and their availability will be given to Students who have applied for tutoring in that subject matter and time slots.

<br><br>
A Student’s parent or guardian must complete TWO online forms: a Student's Parent or Guardian Information Form and a Student's Parent or Guardian Permission Form.
<br>
<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:0%;">Note: Two forms are required because (i) only the Information Form will be exchanged between potential Tutors and Student’s families and (ii) only the Information Form can be modified from time to time without re-submitting a copy of a driver’s license or State ID since only the Permission Form deals with legal matters.
<br>
<p style="margin-left:0%; margin-right:0%;">After a student’s application form is accepted, a list of Tutors whose subjects, grade level and available time slots seem to match will be sent to the parent’s or guardian’s email. It will be the job of the Student’s parent or guardian to contact one or more of the Tutors listed to (i) try to find a match and (ii) interview the Tutor further, if desired.
<br><br>It will be the job of the Tutor to notify volunteertutor.org that they are no longer looking for a match.

More Details: </font></u></b>
<br><br>
volunteertutor.org is an assumed name of Volunteertutor,LLC (a Michigan Liminted Liability Company). Its email address is: <u>info@volunteertutor.org</u>.
<br><br>Under no circumstances will Tutors have in-person meetings with Students because of meeting through volunteertutor.org.
<br><br>Under no circumstances will Tutors or volunteerturtors.org charge Students for
anything.
<br><br>Tutors will need an email address and a Zoom account. Students will need access to a Zoom account at a specific time on, at least, a weekly basis. They will also need access to an email address.
<br><br>Tutors will be screened on the “National Sex Offender Public Website”.
<br><br>Once a Tutor and parent or guardian of a Student have agreed to the match, it will be the job of the Tutor and Student or their parent or guardian to make all further tutoring arrangements. 
<br><br>Tutors are to create their own tutoring program to help their Student. 
<br><br>In addition to making a specific tutoring on-line date, it is recommended that Tutors contact the Student or their parent or guardian the day before the tutoring date to remind them of the next tutoring date and time. 
<br><br>Tutors reading books to early readers may want to use the Caribu website <u> (https://caribu.com</u>). Tutors will have to pay $10/month for an unlimited number of Students to access Caribu. Tutors reading to Students who are struggling with reading basic words or sounding out complex words may benefit from tutoring guidebooks such as the techniques explained in &quot;Teach Reading with Orton-Gillingham&quot;, which was designed for dyslexic readers but can be used with any reader having basic reading difficulties.
<br><br>

Tutors And Students Will Comply with The Following Rules: </font></u></b>
<br><br>Rule #1: No personal contact because of meeting through volunteertutor.org.
<br><br>Rule #2: Tutors - No criticism, sarcasm or belittling, only praise and support. If you can’t do that in any situation, just tell the Student that you don’t feel that YOU are helping them and, therefore, you’re going to discontinue the session.
<br><br>Rule #3: Students - No showing anger or disappointment at the Tutor. If you don’t understand something, you should tell the Tutor what you are not understanding. If you don’t feel the Tutor is helping you or if you feel that the Tutor is bullying you or not being nice to you, just tell the Tutor that YOU don’t think you are benefiting from the session and hang up.

<br><br>

Additional Notes: </font></u></b>
<br><br>Depending on the profiles of the students and teachers who apply, there may be a lag time of several weeks (or more) in matching Tutors with Students (please be patient). There will
be no help for legal, educational, computer or tutoring issues.
<br><br>Tutors are not employees or agents of volunteertutor.org. They cannot speak for the organization.
<br><br>If a Student or Tutor does not work out, you can request a different one.
